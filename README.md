# distribute-profile-picture

You use multiple apps like Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, Slack etc. and you want to be quickly recognized - you choose the same profile picture for all of them.

After some time you have your new shiny favourite profile picture of yourself that you'd like to use for all of these apps. This little CLI tool will help you distribute it with a single command.
